> There won't just be hope...
> There will probably be a lot of despair too...
>
>  I don't know what kind of future awaits us...
>
> ...but our futures are ours!
> I won't let anyone take them!
>
> I've decided... I'm done running away...
>
> I will fight for my future!
> I will fight alongside the future that everyone created for me!
>
> It's not for anyone else's sake but my own!
>
> I...am not Izuru Kamukura...
